"Unfortunately, I was unable to complete all the tasks requested for the X-app. However, some of the tasks that were implemented include the following:

- A bash script file for automated execution.
- An environment configuration file.
- Changing the Springboot banner.
- A basic app skeleton with an initial page that fetches some products from the backend.
- A navigation bar that manages page navigation.

Although not all tasks were accomplished, these implemented features lay a foundation for further development and customization of the X-app."
